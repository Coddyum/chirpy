# HTTP Server in Go

A guided learning project built while following the **Boot.dev** course _“Learn HTTP Servers in Go”_.

This repository explores how to build and structure an HTTP server from scratch using Go — focusing on the core concepts behind routing, handlers, middleware, and response handling.
